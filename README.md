# Docker Ruby

This is the Git repo of the [Docker "Unofficial Ruby Image"](https://github.com/tiarly/docker-ruby) for [`ruby`](https://hub.docker.com/_/ruby/) (not to be confused with any official `ruby` image provided by `ruby` upstream).

The [full image description on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/tiarly) is generated/maintained over in [the docker-library/docs repository](https://github.com/tiarly/docker-ruby).

## Why?

The reason for this varian Ruby base repo is to offer the possibility to use old versions of ruby (E.g. 2.5.3) with newer versions of alpine (E.g: 3.9, 3.10)
